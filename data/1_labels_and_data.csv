","[Music] so guys we here again our last video only few weeks away from the greatest change in the marine industry or at least in our generation I am more 20/20 so far is the hot topic here we are playing pool on a table that is made of salt for concrete so I'll break so with only a few weeks still some challenges in the implementation basically what do you guys see well I think the big question that people are asking themselves of course is what's availability going to be like what's price going to be like how's it all going to play out because they're present there's a lot of stuff we know about the general picture right I got a ship operator you really focus on what does it mean to me what are the specifics from my vessels and that it becomes 1:42 hard to answer and we see that the shipping companies are now well preparing for this I think one of the main challenges is the compatibility ship compatibility and how do they plan their banking operations how do you make sure that you will have an almost empty tank in your banking how do you handle a few awards get I think that's going to be very important make sure that you understand temperatures viscosity is all the property but you'll make sure the avoid problems so it's understanding these things and understanding what type of you are going to be available in its location pressure pressure no but you see challenges what do you see because I know you guys done a lot of research in this sense so interesting to see what you see in there yeah crystal stone mentioned there's a lot about the compatibility issue because with the zero point car we're getting into new field grades as you know they're very well of course which are very very different from what we've been using ships before Italy and even though there's a lot of industry guidance out there from many different sources you still need to actually apply that to your bunkering practices then how do you maintain segregation what operational constraints yeah but I think maritime industry as shown in the trend is capacity to learn actually one of the things I always find interesting is for me that this industry has to change myself if you look at the ship ecosystem it's not only the fuel is gonna have to change like you say we're moving from fuel procurement fuel fuel management but there's a lot of stakeholders that have to be involved tanks have to change on the lubricant side as well we know that let me look at we know that we know that and think things have changed and the lowest sofa level is going to mean a difference in the chemistry of lubricants as well so Krista I know you guys have been all of research in terms of the users of the ship implementation plan having the vessels to plan during insights you've got you can share from from what we have what is interesting is now we also hear some concerns about the new lubricants you know protecting engines has to the world once there's a need for more frequent inspections yes from our perspective we formulated lubricants and marine lubricants verb fifty sixty years with the mobile guard Brandon we've been planning for five more 20 20 on the lubricant sides for well over well over five years so ever since that first eco was was introduced and that reduces the N but the need for additional what we call neutral detergency to be in the package to make sure that those engines still have that cleanliness and have that condition is something that I know especially we work to make sure is the case but yet to your point I don't think I don't think we're gonna get away from the need to monitor the condition of the cylinder ala is the piston in the engine the engine is a ball I think that's only going to get more and more prevalent we have a source of gear that from our global surface from the condition motor and service so we be able to digitize that data system and what we found when we did the latest dive was that only 25% of vessels or optimally right yeah I'm not surprised to be honest because you do in condition water in bathing you ball analysis doing particle analysis all of that it's kind of a second thing esoteric professional but it's not something that people normally do it's you find anymore in the offshore sector where yeah the money is more available I guess have you seen already customers sweet symphony' lubricants yet so again in line with their fields friction we've seen customers to pick up mainly in those in those bigger ports but we have seen a lot to pick up on on our bubble guard 540 which is the 40 BN cylinder oil but that also interestingly is on the medium speed so on the four-stroke side so your route to compliance doesn't only dictate your cylinder oil choice dictates your your four-stroke engine oil choice as well so we've seen a lot more uptick in our 20 BN product right so heaven 420 where that's been again design for that point five news so here the engine oils are the cylinder oil both honeypots way we also you give me that compliance and that's a very good sign that all these and operators are already preparing not only the few times but also the new boy it's short it's John and what do you think about enforcement this long discussion is usually by enforcement police being forcefully enforcement be uniform across the world etc it's a complicated question a very complicated answer of course it will be enforced every country who's a party to annex six of Marple and that covers roughly 90% of the tonnage of the world yeah it's obliged to enforce yeah but the thing is that they take this into their own national legislation and the IMO doesn't set any kind of fine level or criteria for detention or anything like that that's up to each individual country today to deal with it as it sees fit so yeah I mean support state and flag yeah flags are not really going it'll be involved in enforcement but it's really about for state when it comes to the inspections and all that so we'll be getting a long uniform picture you missing strict enforcement in Europe in certainly in North America Singapore Singapore of course obviously but other parts of the world it may be a little bit less stringent at least at least initially we'll see how it plays out with betting on likes enforcement this is what I would call a very much a high-risk strategy yeah you don't want to do that because you will see a rigid enforcement it also brings us to the issue of the this sampling the testing analysis yeah your samples because you literally look at the produce that will be provided will be right off my bench yeah I mean there are very clear guidance in terms of suppliers and whoever is making this rather opening to think about cyclically on the solfege the joint industry guidelines so extensively about that even the public available specification from ISO has from reference so um yeah if that's the reason why preparedness for me has always been the stay of that this industry has to have it and increases but in the brings us into this whole issue of you're going to talk about what pankley about pipe cleaning but it's just a question of taking your load of appliance fuel because again what do you then burn is going to be picking up from the previous few loads absolutely so in an inadvertent non-compliance is a favorite term that we've been talking about the loss yeah and we don't want to get there so preparedness is really key to to that whole issue I have a no idea you know what the fine levels are going to be if you get into I mean one thing is deliberately take you to point five percent when you're in yet you don't comply yeah if you're at 0.53 and 56 how are you going to be treated by poor State Patrol I am always very clear in that sense it says that the port state will gather all the evidences look at your preparedness so at the end of the day again it goes back to preparedness how you can demonstrate how to prepare you've been all the effort that you've done in order to be to be ready and in terms of fines we know the fines are different across the world I mean Marshall Islands is a flag state it's going up to $1,000,000 for non-compliance in the u.s. twenty thousand dollars per day in Singapore there are discussion about detention the rest so it's not going to be used because of the way the legislation is ratified and protein into the country legislation but will be severe and that's just the monetary effect then there is your own reputation on issue I think that what do we need to bear in mind here it's of course not that when we talk about using extremely clean fuels we're talking 0.1% that's really really clean fuel very mind that would be use for land transportation is a heck of a lot cleaner than that and I am not sure if the public at large politicians of course which represent them are going to in a long term be willing to accept that ships operating in municipal areas are going to be allowed to emit more than trucks or cars operating in musical areas let's see a long-term trend driving towards even stricter regulation something on this not necessarily driven by the IMO but even locally and regionally an ad in but for fortunes alkis [Music] so let's do the world while the things we still get asked and one of the things I think is still some confusion carriage back that's a very good propaganda I think we should make very clear what the current one is and what it is not anyways now maybe let's start with up it is not a grace period like the Korean throne starts on March first 2020 and after that day you're not allowed to carry any - for fuel oil on board unless it's a little scary at all on the vessel but even though the current ban comes into effect on the first of March yet from the first of January you're not allowed to use that fuel anyway even if it's remote unless you're discovering scopes what that means is not if you kept some - fuel on board after the 1st of January we up to here to put the port authorities that you did not use the fuel mediatic analogues on the median the video is actually what is proving what is the fuel quality that we are using you cannot mix this field with loss or fulfill to make it compliant mix or blend on board because the port authorities are going to take the bank and deliver if you have 300 turns left on board on the 1st of January in each planet that free in return before you need to man sit before the 1st of January otherwise you have two months to get rid of it and then that will be probably cost associated with almost cost in addition to the money you've already paid for that don't even feel exactly exactly I mean this is a really important point because some corners so the world there are misunderstandings that these two months somehow represent a grace period where you're where you are allowed to burn what's what's on board and that's definitely not the case and I sure had commercial people calling me to ask you this question because they had people prodding tonnage who've been saying it well yes you can burn it during the grace period there's no such thing as a grace period you have the rest of this year to get rid of your non-compliant feeling otherwise you're going to it's going to cost you money it's exactly the same situation on the lubricant side as well you think if you have that higher self of fuel oil on board right now and you're gonna move 2.50 compliant your from your BN standpoint you're gonna either go from a 70 B n or 100 B n likely down to that forty B n so you need to manage those stocks of 70 and 100 on board to make sure you have you have been able minimal left when you need to use that that lower level a sofa well there is no requirement to debunk further non-compliant they're all they're all performance issues really sad on for you know one teacher you want to run out that high BN on the on the low sofa we know from experience to gain from the he cares that you're gonna have deposits you're gonna have issues around those piston rings you know fisting crown reasons once that's more of a will see a slower issues of corrosion it still has an impact on the bottom line how long do you have before you change your lubricants from the moment you start visiting compliant fuels we would recommend as soon as soon as possible you need to manage your fuel transition with your lubricants transition so again go back to what we're talking about around the formulation of lubricants you can't or where we're recommending not to mix where possible so talking around that neutral detergency very good theory is talking around that neutral detergency even if you just mix the appropriate ratio of a 25 and a 70 to get 40 the performance is not going to be there exactly so zero for 50% off of a plant fuel and support the majority of the interest we will use there are other choices some cheap pointers of me that's correct once I heard a lot about in the last year year in the cuff is a scrubbers okay and we expect to have roughly 3,000 citrus covers in early 2020 and that will take about 15 percent of the marine fuel consumption because that's typically larger vessel by a shift basis or a volume basis of volume Oasis that's going to be roughly 15% in consumption are coming out of roughly three thousand six another another route that we hear we heard about when speaking to customers is there's LNG so liquefied natural gas are there any statistics or insights you have from the market yes there are currently hundred seventy six in operation and another complex 1670 on out there okay so L Lindsay is not going to be the main means of compliance for existing vessels now all we see is up for new for new buildings many owners they're considering LNG seriously when they are placing orders and what we sit same thing now is that we see moving from small vessels for example are small positive version of supply vessels now moving to very large container vessels crew suits yep oil tankers starting using alleges appeal and this is the big change we see in the future and also we see that in most new building projects Allen sees proceeded not necessarily selected but I see one of the criteria considered seriously as an option 2020s is not even the past is the present and everything that's we've done you've done shipowners that over all the stakeholders led us to up today still few urban myths though the new 0.2 percent compliant fuels harvest pacification well they you heard the ISIL specification if you have the probably available specific a to the past that's out list now that's supposed to cater to sort of commingling and above lending issues you always need to manage your fuels and shipping companies are done that for time immemorial the mingling the management challenges yet it's probably increased somewhat but it's it's not as if it's a paradigm shift global so floor cap is not gonna be enforced we have to think that it's only a few weeks to go before enforcement day now it's very late even if there was any political will to do that there is simply no time and the industry is already almost ready people are already in the compliance fields today it's very difficult to go back I think maybe from your perspective are you ready to provide a solution when you formulate 0.50 percent so the compliant view is very different way to run a big machine like the exactly so our choice has been very clear based on the feedback from ship ownership owner indicated that the main compliance option at the time which became a choice was 0.50 percent so compliant few [Music] [Music] no pressure Joe do it then good game guys good game thank you we've had the industry's prepared thank you very much for having this game with us [Music]",UCyx0bjM5ww3NcHcELvKO-ZQ

",[Music] [Music] I'm great to see you once again great to see you again my friend I think that you and I have met many times over the years but I'm pretty sure this is the first time that you and I met around the chest exactly first time around the chess table and first time playing chess with you exactly and by the way this chess table is actually made of soulful concrete and as you know sulfur is the very topic that as a top of mind for our industry these days what this IMO 2020 means for the maritime and Port Authority of Singapore as the leading bunkering port in the world the MPA has been working very closely with all our stakeholders to prepare for the IMO 2020 regulations so we have been working on two fronts one to instill confidence to ensuring clear availability and two to prepare our pot as well as the thousands of ships under the Singapore registry or ships so on fuel availability we have been working very closely all our licensed banker suppliers engaging them talking to them getting regular updates to make sure that they are available to make sure that they are able to supply supply compliant fields we have published information sheet detailing the list of banker suppliers and the range of compliant fields that they can supply for 2020 I always think about the industry the marine industry as our industry it's not the industry of the suppliers and not the industry of the shipowners is the industry of all stakeholders working together and drive in this industry forward walking together the industry is a very important element for us which is why we have been working very closely with the Singapore shipping Association for the SSA so together with the SSA we have published two technical guide books on complying with iMore 2020 so this guidebook will provide the details and the options for compliance and also what to do when ships call it the pot come 2020 so we believe that through this close collaboration we can together navigate 2020 and that's important because the thing that one of the things I noticed when I talk to customers or other stakeholders is the availability of information and and the end tangible information put together by experts so Luca tell me the IMO has announced a robust offer regulations for some time why is it meant for you was it meant for and so more how's your preparations coming along it starts with our long-term investment in our refineries it then continues with the 0.50 percent sulfur compliant fuels that we have announced since April and October of last year and then it's integrated and complemented by the new range of fuels and lubricants that are an integral part of how we think about preparedness for IMO 2020 what about enforcement because that's the other question I get all the times and I'm sure that you get that all the time as well exactly I'm getting lots of questions about enforcement but Luca you know enforcement for MPA is not nothing new it's not new to us it's very true Singapore is a party to all the Mapo and axis and we happy enforcing our regulations so this is an additional enforcement point that we have to work into our regular enforcement regime so we enforce Mapo regulations through our port state control in flextech control regime so specifically for the IMO 2020 rule ships will be selected for inspections based on our internal research risk assessment matrix we also take into account whether the vessel has declared a phoner that's another important point for us yeah so in terms of specifics as to how we enforce it I think broadly there are three levels first we'll look at the documents or a document tokenize check and if there's reason to inspect further will do on-site verification using portable software test kits and it has reason to suspect or to investigate further and then we'll take a sample represented a sample and send this sample to a creditor testing laboratory for detailed analysis I think that this is a great example and again going back to how always our discussion how do we give peace of mind to ship ons aldo80 peace of mind through today industries another very concrete and intangible example so another compliance option as you know is fuel oil in conjunction with scrubbers I think that the numbers here from a number of sources may be up to three thousand ships fitted with scrubbers by 2020 but I've seen that at the back end of last year the MPA banned open loop scrubbers it's only bit more about that Luca let me clarify we are not banning open loop scrubbers in fact we are prohibiting the discharge of wash water from open loop scrubbers when ships call it a part of Singapore take difference yes there's a big difference there so we have taken this decision after close consultation with various stakeholders including avid other government agencies in Singapore like the National Environment Agency the National Parks Board so it was a decision well considered decision taking into account the science behind wash water discharge as you know Singapore is a small country geographically we have also very limited pot waters so and this pot waters is shared by many users including maritime even aquaculture and also recreation yeah so we have to be vigilant and also safeguard the quality of waters of our coastal waters yeah and the distinction is quite important come 2020 we expect a change so from july 2019 this year we will level the playing field and make sure that all our bank the tankers will supply all types of fields through mass flow meters but looking a little hit to the future we also prepare ourselves to be a LNG bunker ad port so as you heard we've put in place various incentive schemes to encourage the object of LNG banking in Singapore and we are doing quite okay we've seen some good results so far today we have two sucks breathing regularly and operating well in our ports regulations yes thank you and but we believe that this effort needs to take on a international dimension which is why we have worked very closely with eleven other like-minded ports to LNG bunkering focus group to collectively share expertise exchange best practices and to harmonize bunkering procedures for LNG bunkering so this will instill greater confidence - for the uptake of LNG bunkering globally what's your take off LNG as a compliant field option well before I'll give you my take on LNG let me take your night Alan G is gonna be an important part of the marine fuel mix we see LNG being about 10 percent of the marine fuel mix by 2040 so about 35 million tons per annum so it's an important component of the marine fuel mix of the future alongside distillate fuels and alongside the residual fuels ranging from 0.50 percent down to zero point ten and anything above 0.50 as we discussed before to be used with scrubbers is a fuel that enables a significant elimination of Sox reduction in NOx reduction in particulate matter so there are a number of advantages to that the logistics for LNG are fast developing we've got more and more gas supply vessels like-minded people that understand that this is a new fuel understand that it comes with a different way of thinking about that this is a cryogenic fuel as soon as you know and therefore safety is an important parameter and the work that we're doing together as part of s gmf the Society for gasses marine fuel is an important part for that so we believe that LNG is going to be a tangible part of the marine fuel mix in the future and there are a number of activities that we are currently considering specifically for LNG for marine application great looks lights my turn looks like your move to take your horse oh ah to take my knight okay I'll better get myself covered [Laughter] I feel that there is a bit of a shift in sentiment in the marine industry what do you mean by the shipping sentiment in the industry IMO 2020 is not just about any compliant fuel it's about the right compliant fuel we talk about 0.50 percent so for complying fuel for example and I think that at the end of the day is not just about complying with sulphur compliant with sulfur is a ticket to the game is the minimum threshold that you have to meet after that I think that there are a number of other properties in the fewers that are really important we done a significant amount of additional testing starting with the PCN estimated seating number for all the fuels that we have announced as well as FIA testing fuel ignition analysis really important because that we can measure how a fuel really burns so we've done all of this additional due diligence for all our fuels to demonstrate to our customer you were talking before about peace of mind yeah that's what we've done and I welcome the opportunity for everyone that provides fuel any supplier of fuels to do it exactly the same due diligence because this is what customers think and what customer believe it is a right fuel so look at Exxon Mobil is ready the MPA is ready what do you think about the rest of the industry they're serene she's getting ready a number of companies got a lot of very detailed Vance plan they start putting them in place if you think about also I am always done with a ship implementation plan that has helped that we've tried to do our part they're gonna be people that are gonna be there ready now the people there may be a bit lagging behind but I know that the MPA is doing their part so we're doing as much as we can to make sure that not only we are ready not only you are ready but the oil industry is ready this is a joint responsibility [Music] has always really good to talk to you and you know really appreciated this at professional level the majority of the games or chess actually finish in a draw so I'm not a professional player should not a professional player but yeah we end up like professionals with the drobe it looks like a drawer maybe we should have a rematch I think I'll take you on one that one [Music],UCyx0bjM5ww3NcHcELvKO-ZQ

","[Music] [Music] Exxon Mobil and WEICan are working together to 
develop new technology and lubricants that&#39;s   going to help improve the wind industry. WEICAN
began as the Atlantic wind test site back in   1981 we&#39;re involved in wind energy research 
we also toy around with some solar projects   energy storage as well. These partnerships if 
you step back they&#39;re all about innovation   and the way Innovation happens is when you bring 
different people together with different skill   sets and it&#39;s that intersection of different 
areas of expertise that allows you to discover   things faster. Some of the things we&#39;re looking at 
are improving the lifetime of the lubricant used   in the wind turbine looking at reducing wear of 
components you might see in the wind turbines one   of the other things we&#39;re looking at is being able 
to operate the wind turbines non-stop.  Partnerships are really important to WEICan because we&#39;re so 
small we don&#39;t have the expertise to carry out   this research on our own. Exxon Mobil has some 
very specialized expertise that we don&#39;t have. Exxon Mobil Works in a lot of areas involving 
lubricants we&#39;re involved in lubricants for you   know jet airplanes you know ships a lot of folks 
are probably familiar with mobile one being used   for your cars and trucks. We&#39;ve got innovation in 
terms of our understanding of lubricants WEICan   on the other hand has this great understanding of 
the industry, academia, what government policies and   regulations are doing, and it&#39;s the combination of 
the those areas of expertise coming together that   can enable us to make advances even faster. As 
wind becomes a bigger part of our grid we need   to be more reliable so operating longer and more 
frequently is important. I think one of the most   exciting thing about this partnership is be able 
to get out and actually see your lubricants in use   and being able you know climb up a wind turbine 
and actually see the parts being lubricated   and the power being generated I think is one of 
the most exciting things about this partnership",UCvNc3rg1Aa9wSPECYWEfcPg

A hydrogen powered future is good for heavy industry and good for lower-emissions. ⚡️ In Baytown, we’re not just producing #hydrogen. We plan to capture 98% of our own CO2 emissions through carbon capture and storage (#CCS). This makes Baytown the largest low-carbon hydrogen project in the world at planned startup.

",[Music] we've gone through major change in the industry in 2020 previous to that there was huge debate across the industry arguments I've never seen IMO so active in all the problems and challenges of taking the shipping industry into a world where the fuel sulfur was going to be dropped down to 0.5 but when we got into January 2020 the shipping world was quite quiet there were no ships running aground ships seem to be able to get the fuel they needed and why was that collaboration cooperation and all that fighting generated The energy needed the challenge now is by 2050 we need to see a significant change in the industry in the greenhouse gas margins are dropped by somewhere in the region 70 we need to see Zero shipping by 2030 in order to achieve the targets that Imo's looking at and the industry as a whole is looking at I think it's the industry I think people are working on the tours lowering the greenhouse gas emissions uh some by assessing the ships what is the where they stand right now because if you don't know where you stand you don't know where you're heading to and they also signal from IMO there's a current regulation that's going to impose on the CII semp and so on all the regulation that makes ship owners and the operator to think about their operations and how can they make it better capture the low hang fruit first and then think about the fusion like ships are typically last uh 20 years 25 years if we are to make major change in 2050 and this is the time difference I mean we strive to offer Solutions for basically any kind of fuel so we are agnostic um so the choice for a certain type of fuel in a certain region is largely driven by costs which means or can mean penalties or just other regulation favoring or disincentivizing certain fuel choices or technology choices and we try to cater for all of those so to give you one specific example the current EU legislation the fit for 55 package includes a proposal that is called fueling your maritime that attaches carbon factors to specific fuels and specific colors of fuels so Pathways different Pathways and and in the four stroke so medium high speed engine segment that would mean for fossil LNG that those ships are not complied by 25 anymore if we don't do anything so what can we do companies such as Exxon so energy companies and providers and Banco operators can provide bio or synthetic blends of LNG of methane and we have to work on getting methane slip in order so with an inner engine developments changes updates but also methane oxidation catalyst so we try to do our technological bit in there but obviously there are other players that need to work on the the fuel in the last few years there's been a huge push on Energy Efficiency efficient operations starting to put hybrids on on changing about putting new paints bubbling air under the hull any percentage we can cut there's a lot of pressure coming on the industry as a whole but what can realistically where could we take the next step because regulation is coming into this year on the carbon index for ships intensity index ships will have to demonstrate what they're doing to reduce it so what are your thoughts on that are we ready for that Civil War Charters our job is to move the energy molecules right for society's needs whether it's from A supplier between our Affiliates for our JVS or to the end customers you know we we move energy I think two years back we didn't seem to be understanding the the size of the problem today two years later we are we're in a situation where people are waking up realizing understanding that this is a huge Global problem and this needs collaboration across stakeholders like us and Beyond us we're talking to our industry partners and then we were trying to find opportunities for collaboration now we got the feedback feedback included well we'll do some speed reductions okay that's probably an easy Fit For A near-term it may work for certain ship owners and certain trades may not work for many others then the next feedback was will look at technology changes like the ones you said air lubrication systems power takeoffs you know putting better paints void efficiencies there's a lot in Voyage efficiencies that we can do because at the moment the Voyages are planned they're supposedly efficient but they can be improved just in time and other other kind of opportunities are there biofuels methanol LNG we're doing some biofuel trials with our value chains Exxon Mobile value chains we are looking at chartering newer LNG ships though we still need to understand whether regulation is going to help us go beyond 2026 or not but that's that's the change we are making and then we are also looking at Carbon capture storage Technologies which are down the future yes there's collaboration uh or at least there is uh there are mechanisms for collaboration coming up and then finally is the regulation which is driving it all [Music] right I mean you were talking about different fields and collaboration I think it'd be good candidate if you just um just expound it most people will know now pretty well which are the fuels out there but which are the key players going forward the fuels in the race so to speak I was starting off with now that is more available and closer to the Future yeah it will be biofuels or the biofuel plans so these few that are derived from biomass such as vegetables such as seed oil seed and so and then they are manufactured and turned into a biodiesel which can then blend it into existing marine field in fact the marine field standard now has a few category for this sort of biofuel plant but now what we're looking at is to go beyond that to have a higher biofuel plan to further lower the greenhouse gas emissions and of course the advantage of that is that you know it's a lot more established it's compatible with the existing uh field infrastructure and and then citizenships can use it and take advantage of it and you don't need to make a further investment and some of the concern I would say this to uh is the field availability aspect because the same molecule can also be used for other Transportation chess sets such as the heavy duty industry heavy duty trucks as well as now we'll talk about in aviations so there may not be enough molecule going around for every industry and for every players in the same I mean there's also you know people talk about perhaps using hydrogen itself because hydrogen potentially can be made abundantly and hydrogen potency have some potentials here for marine when you burnt or reacted in a fuel cell the only product you get is water and the biggest challenge perhaps for hydrogen is the how do you store it yes that's right yeah hydrogen is the lightest molecule in the universe and in order to carry a large quantity that's sufficient to power ships across ocean you need to store a lot of them and showing a huge quantity of hydrogen is not an easy task you could compress it or liquefy it and even then the energy density is about one-fifth to one tenth of what you get from diesel fuel so to operator that means the tank will be 10 times bigger so that could be a challenge or maybe you know for some application may be very limited right behind us now and keeping us safe at this moment is a small band of professional Mariners trained in in oil and hydrocarbons but but if we go into different disciplines cryofuels chemical type derivatives these guys have to be retrained and that's not a five minute process you might have to spend six months or a year on the training in a different role entirely on a chemical tanker or a gas tanker in order to endorse your qualifications so that the guy's still a master Mariner but to get the chemical endorsement or the gas endorsement is to retrain from an oil tanker and that's going to take at least a year I'd suggest per individuals I mean ammonia sounds to be the solution when Marie IMO looks at tag to wake there's no carbon so it's really good but on a life cycle analysis um asked me when that's a play it's a different story and the toxicity um and I know for Lloyd's as a classification Society we've just made the rules now for building a ship with ammonia and having been working as an ammonia ship being launched for 20 24 25 will come out and operate on ammonia so the process is beginning it doesn't necessarily mean that harmonia will be the dominant fuel we may be one of the solutions for the future we're seeing on this box here with a single type of fuel petroleum fuels and different grades Tesla or residual but essentially a petroleum fuel being supplied to ships and that's been done for decades and we're fortunate to have here the bars that we're sitting on and we're being heated not only from up there but down here as well but one of the biggest struggles for small batch companies is how do they Transit I mean if we well we've got passengers coming in here they want LNG or gas oil or heavy fuel well I can give you the petroleum fuels but the gas oil an LNG ship will need a another bar so we're talking about multiple fuels does that mean we're going to have multiple fuels available in the sport [Music] well I'd like to come in Timaya as a barge owner and also from the shipping chip on his perspective the someone mentioned to me a while back that our Industries had a a steady state if you like for about a hundred years bunkering has been been around for for about a Century fuel or uh I'm talking of Gasol and I came into it 40 years ago and it was a steady state then it was it was a mature industry uh as you alluded to earlier we've had the sulfur regulations kick in over the last 10 years or so we've had time to prepare for that that's great but uh we're now facing a fundamental changes as you say now I had a ship on a Saturday we're coming up to a major crossroads for 2030 and it's it's a six Lane Highway and ship owners are on a dilemma of which which technology to adopt and from our perspective this part was settled now it's a 20 million dollar investment if I go for we're a relatively small company many barge operators around the world are relatively small concerns we don't have the will on our backs to to go out into the Blue Sky Thinking and take a punt on a technology and unproven so we need some certainty and certain and even for the for the bigger shipping companies that business like certainty doesn't like uncertainty so from our perspective legislation is going to be key to this this is a global issue it's a global industry and it's a Global Response and we welcome that because we need guidance and that's not just the the barge operators but the big shipping companies too I've spoke to a a very Channel Ferry operator recently who said I'm looking to build new ships my dilemma is how do I fuel them going forward I need to be future proof for the next 25 30 years we want to do the right thing but but we can't afford to do it in one big swoop it has to be done in stages from IMO and from government level and a global move towards clarifying some of the options that are going for for us to to move into maybe if I may because the discussion we're having now around all those alternative fuels we had those discussions when LNG was introduced as the first alternative so how to finance it where is the Bank of infrastructure coming from is the technology ready and so on yeah so similar discussion safety crew training um so first of all I believe um we should not wait for IMO we know that even the IMO targets right now are not sufficient to reach to Paris climbing the court targets yeah so even the targets which are pretty high by many standards are not sufficient um so what we I think we'll see is regional regulation like in EU that in a way will export its regulation or regulatory standards to other regions and then others will just follow I appreciate the point that shipping is a global business and I think one step into that direction is the cloud Bank declaration and the green corridors which is an attempt to in a way circumvent the general agreement in IMO and Fast Track Global setup of Supply chains and solutions I think we have now 24 countries also assembled in that declaration to see where we have a corridor that runs on ammonia for example or any kind of other fuel that is relevant um I think the next thing that needs to happen is a bit of flexibility so I don't believe we will see any one successor yes we will have a mix so we need to all prepare for a mix that's what we are doing because we are offering solutions for all kind of fuels I think this is what the energy companies will have to do and how do we Finance the whole thing we probably will see change in contractual agreements between charterer and Chip owner sharing the burden or sharing the benefits if we see just look back two years on the biofuel right I mean the Netherlands gave an incentive to suppliers to provide Fame to the industry industry immediately picked up on that and I want to put 20 I want to put 30 IMO wasn't going to record that but the stakeholders were yeah so the stakeholders have quite a play don't they so there's a benefit for the owner of the ship to be able to promote a lower carbon factor and that his ship can be prepared and ready to run on biofuels and so we've had a whole series of Trials I've been personally involved in about 10 sea trials why were we involved because the regulation was a stumbling block to this whole move from petroleum to biofuels and that regulation has just has been overridden with a unified interpretation which we work through IX and others from the industry also France and other countries were pushing and now we have a release from it so where I'm coming from it there are the first movers normally it doesn't normally come from where you expect yeah yeah and my response would be Regulators accountable yeah I mean what I mean with that is government money yeah for example in the case of a bunker operators in Germany we currently have a subsidy program for LNG bunker vessels yeah so you get money for building an LNG bunker vessel yeah um with all those new uh fees and penalties coming into place fuel you Maritime energy taxation potential emission trading scheme the money that goes into the EU budget will have to be spent yeah so why not using it to cross-subsidize the uptake of cleaner fuels conversions yeah retrofits to cleaner vessels we're being tasked with doing the right thing and Industry wants to do the right thing legislation does have to work with us yes it's not so easy to be a first movement if you if you're the first mover outside the legislation you've had a business anyway shipping is it underpins the global economy like it or not 90 of World Trade beyond that is is is by sea and that's what makes the world go around for us in terms of as a human rights so we need to balance those those needs with the needs to keep the protective the environment of course but I would say two blockers regulatory blockers are the igf code so I know we have intermediate guidelines for methanol but we don't have anything for ammonia um I wouldn't see the classes or the class societies they all have published something and will publish something by the end of this year for all the fuels that's not an issue in my view and another hurdle regulatory hurdle I see actually in ports yeah so when I attend conferences and see representatives from Port Authorities they tell us I mean I'm not going to name the board here but they tell us okay you with your new ammonia engine you to us that it's safe and then we start considering bunkering operations in our Port yeah so with this kind of wait and see attitude um we're not going to go very far I mean I've been in the oil and gas industry promoting LNG it took 10 to 10 to 15 years to get where we are with regards to supply chain setup that is somewhat acceptable yeah if we're going to take another 10 15 for methanol ammonia and hydrogen then we're surely not going to hit anything that's a hugely important Point Supply infrastructure it underpins this if I take care of this if I want to go and bunker this container ship in the forest of Hampton I'll supplies of fuel oil and gas or literally two miles away at the local Refinery and that's the same the world over that there are there are hubs at terminals at all the shipping hubs but but if I want to to load an alternative fuel outside of the hydrocarbon where do I get it from and it's in my bunker barge is perhaps five six thousand tons the biggest bunker barges maybe 10 or 15 000 times ships like this will take that that amount and particularly if it's a lower calorific value of fuel they'll be even bigger but you you need to be able to fetch the stuff and the supply chain is too long we live in a just in time world it really is this is all stuff coming in and it's going out the next day if I don't turn up with bunkers in a reliable manner I'm going to disrupt that supply chain so so the supply infrastructure which we've had the benefit of for the last hundred years of the of the hydrocarbon oil and fuel or world if that's moved for moving out of that we need to think seriously about this the Supply locations for whatever the fuel is going to be an LNG is a great Point case in point that's probably the most mature of all the Alternatives and we've been seriously looking at bunkering energy for over a decade now and it's still frankly hard work hard going it's getting there but but it's it's tough and and that's the best option at the moment so we've got to be realistic at what we can achieve [Music] methanol or ammonia or hydrogen are new fuels you know supply chain disruptions are potentially out there which we have to manage and I think in the end it's all finally I think it's up to this you know how do we manage that I mean it's a lot up to the ship owner who has to find the screws the training and whatever goes beyond that with this multi-fuel that's linked to the whole safety aspect it's not just about understanding the safety and how you handle fuel handling it safely safety is Paramount without safety there is nothing and the individuals the people are fundamental to safety it's not really Machinery much of the time it's individuals it's people that make the difference in this world we think we can just do most things autonomously so can we not design safety into the whole operation in other words you don't need such experienced food to operate I'm just looking at another side because we're going to need to look at how much can we design out the risk the mitigation mitigate the problems out there your question is almost philosophical can we engineer our way out of the planet's problems yeah of which decarbonization of shipping is one yeah um to a certain degree I would say yes and we are certainly doing our bit uh to do hazards hazards for the various fuels or the fuel options that are on the table and also avoid leakages and minimize slips and we actually have patents pending for ammonia recirculation system a catch system so there are certain things when it comes to an environmental aspect that we are working on and that we try to find Technical Solutions for and then there are others where we actually go deep into the procedures and processes yeah but I think I mean unless our planet is run by robots you will never take out the human element okay with all the transitions who play and as quick as possible to all this alternative field safety must be the first Factor well I couldn't agree with what you're saying and this gradual transition this hybridization of Technologies to me is key as you said earlier we cannot afford failure failure is not an option if we have an accident we want these alternative fuels it will set us back tremendously and so which we can't take we talk about alternative fields we talk about some efficiency measures and then on the run you just talk about carbon capture and Storage and all trees are value options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because remember here we are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so you can done it by not burning as much fuel which is the efficiency bit or burning field that has low carbon so you don't emit as much carbon or greenhouse gas emission and finally is you could continue to burn those but why that you can capture that on board and then once then they capture CO2 and then permanently stored in the site and then that can also eventually reduce the greenhouse gas emissions you may have heard of something called Green hydrogen blue hydrogens and gray hydrogen and the color refers to the view how the energy has come from the major field for example green hydrogen is derived from renewable energy such as wind and solar While Blue hydrogen is in the production process the any CO2 emission capture and for gray hydrogen is I mean that the hydrogen is derived from natural gas but the trouble is the availability of the renewable energy is limited and the whatever the energy we produce others sectors such as power sectors and Industry might also looking for that,UCyx0bjM5ww3NcHcELvKO-ZQ

925007000949719_5900777613372608,"⚡️ Working to produce energy and products to meet people’s needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, shared with Dan Yergin today at CERAWeek by IHS Markit how we’re working to produce critical energy and products to meet society’s evolving needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “We have set a target of net zero in the Permian by 2030. And one of the points of doing that was to demonstrate to the world we can do both. The Permian is one of our fastest-growing production operations, and we’re reducing emissions. Just this year, we’ve reached zero routine flaring and we’re on track to get a net-zero position in the Permian by 2030 while we grow production to 1 million barrels per day.” We view success as working to solve the “and” equation, one in which we can produce the energy and products society needs – and – be a leader in reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and those from others. Learn how reliable, secure energy supply can be maintained even as we all work to help the world progress to a lower-emission energy future. ☞ https://exxonmobil.co/3yjyios",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,https://www.facebook.com/925007000949719/posts/5900777613372608,https://www.junkipedia.org/posts/103539142,status,Facebook,NA,NA,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSTdyandRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0b8566b085ffa05c4a3e8a4b350cd61dd51915ce/post-1099984-103539142-thumbnail,2023-03-07T19:40:55Z,2023-03-07T21:11:09Z,80,ExxonMobil,ExxonMobil,https://facebook.com/925007000949719,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBL0FFQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b359bb3c81d6f5e975c8ffe6b7131736a05ee1e1/13669834_977469509036801_2090763083452223027_n.png%3F_nc_cat=1&ccb=2&_nc_sid=dbb9e7&_nc_ohc=Z_EF6L5Cgh0AX_IVn-A&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&_nc_tp=30&oh=08e831c0055fd76c88e9c7b16b6a4fc5&oe=60066DB4,NA,NA,925007000949719

which gets you about three quarters of the way so   the last quarter takes me about a minute and 
15 seconds to climb. [Music] When you do climb large wind turbine you&#39;re climbing mostly on 
the inside of the Tower so you don&#39;t really   get the perspective on how high you actually are 
until you climb outside the nacelle and then when   you start seeing the tree line below you and 
you realize that you can see miles and miles   out in the horizon it&#39;s quite shocking and quite 
exciting at the same time. [Music]",UCvNc3rg1Aa9wSPECYWEfcPg

а каждый третий уже экономит на еде самцы и международные изоляция за войну в Украине дыра в Российской бюджете растет рекордными танками и экономические ограничения Когда будет нанесен решающий сокрушительный удар русских [музыка] [музыка] Россия одна из самых богатых ресурсами стран мира которая активно разрабатывала свои недра и сколотила состояние на продаже газа нефти угля алмазов но после 24 февраля 2022 года санкционное давление усилилось настолько что нанесло экономики РФ сокрушительный удар последняя десятилетие Кремль планомерно превращал Россию в государство бензоколонку и даже посадил Европу на газовый крючок торговля топливом приносила гигантские Суммы до 120 млрд долларов в год только тратились они не на улучшение благосостояния граждан значительная часть денег фактически шла подготовку к аннексии чужих территорий и полномасштабной после 24 февраля 2022 года цивилизованный мир и амбарго на российское топливо сумел перекрыть поток нефтедолларов стране агрессору врезультате Раф лишилась основного источника пополнения своей госкостной колоссальные потери вследствие ведения потолка цен на нефть и эмбарго на российские нефтепродукты доставляемые морским транспортом А это почти 90 процентов всех поставок так только сначала февраля ежедневная потеря России на уровне 280 миллионов долларов Они получают на руки на руки конкретно на свои счета намного меньше денег чем раньше это важно потому что это новые деньги это ликвидность ликвидные деньги которые не могут использовать для покрытия проблем В бюджете и для финансирования газом ситуации ещё хуже прибыль в феврале этого года упала на 42 процента по сравнению с 2022 в начале войны нам разговорили все что Европе нужно 7 лет для того чтобы избавиться от зависимости от российского газа на самом деле 7 месяцев Для этого хватило это фантастические изменения это трансформация в прошлом году это болезненно потому что в прошлом году Мы помним какие цены были на ГАЗ там 3000 долларов за тысячу кубометров сегодня это 300 400 долларов и все поняли что это был Блеф и пшик это невозможность жизни без российских ресурсов которые получают страна именно от продажи нефтепродуктов и газов доходы сократились А вот война никуда не делась как и растущие расходы на неё Путин тратит на так называемую специальную операцию около трети доходов а скудневшего бюджета страны как результат в казне огромная дыра уже в мае дефицит бюджета достиг 3.5 триллионов рублей а то больше чем российский Минфин планировал на весь 2023 год 20 бюджетом катастрофическая когда хочется жировая прослойка начнётся невыплата зарплат начнутся его не выплаты социальных э всяких гарантий несоблюдение всех социальных гарантий и так далее и так далее последствия санкции для нефтегазовой отрасли России будут ещё тяжелее международном валютном фонде прогнозируют падение экономики РФ на 7%, сегодня срочная перспективе ситуация уже вышла из-под контроля и Путина об этом предупреждают к нему люди с правительства знал когда-то очень хорошо храм люди к нему люди идут и говорят товарищ если такая будет продолжаться мы банкроты к лету Вот только хозяин Кремля этого и слышать не хочет это стиль Путина то что там один институт государственной власти это Диктатор Путин У него горизонт планирования очень маленький вот день прожить до ночи продержаться поэтому я думаю никто не думает на 3-4 месяца А вот президенту РФ всё нипочем уверяет партнеров по евразийскому экономическому Союзу Что потрясение ждать не стоит не произошло увеличить объем Это очень хороший показатель Вот только на самом деле россияне стали тратить меньше это признают даже социологи из придворного Кремлю Всероссийского центра изучения общественного мнения Каждый третий житель РФ вынужден экономить на еде и даже по официальным данным росстата доходы россиян в прошлом году росли медленнее чем цены то есть люди стали беднее но Даже эти официальные данные очень приукрашены говорят экономисты особенно показатель инфляции 12% которые рисуют официальная статистика совсем не то что россияне видят на ценниках но только не для властей и пропагандистов в обществе с экранов побеждать стабильности русских действительно все хорошо цены на продукты абсолютно нормальные В общем санкции не работают часть россиян продолжают верить телевизору а не собственным глазами кошелькам ничего такого особо не потеряли даже если что-то потеряли Ничего страшного у нас замещение все-таки есть Ну и таких людей в России с каждым днем все меньше даже у самых Патриотов и ватников они понимают насколько это на их собственной жизни сказалось как-то ударила по кошельку по карману что Цены только растут значительно побывал в нескольких российских городах ростов-на-дону Воронеж Москву санкт-петербург через прибалтику добрался до Киева рассказывает цены в российских магазинах выше чем в Украине Несмотря на то что на ее территории продолжаются война войска РФ бьют и по зернохранилищам и по продуктовым складам сотни гектаров украинских полей не засеяны из-за близости к фронту и замин и не разорвавшихся боеприпасов для сравнения смотрим цены на сайте одной из российских торговых сетей картофель открываем смотрим цена 63 руб То есть около 30 гривен и видим здесь что 20 гривен примерно на треть картошка будет дешевле в Украине в России за последний год стремительно взлетели цены именно на самое необходимое мясо молочные продукты крупы ещё недавно она жила в Москве училась в университете зарплаты не растут стипендии растёт а цены Да ты уже не можешь там кушать например мясо каждый день тебе нужно кушать Мясо раз в три дня вы говорите образно или это ваш Опыт мой опыт экономить приходилось на всём макароны допустим они стали очень дорогие меня мама прям самый самый дешевые продукты покупают после полномасштабного вторжения в Украину из России ушли крупные международные бренды в магазинах которые еще работают сами взлетели в разы было купить за 2000 рублей сейчас ты их покупаешь за 10.000 руб Сейчас нет дисконтов но хуже всего с лекарствами по данным частного российского исследовательского центра Рамир за последний год они подорожали почти на 30 процентов А в государственном ростате утверждают цены на медпрепараты поднялись всего на 10 процентов это неправда рассказывает жительница Москвы не на Нестерова на некоторое лекарство цены взлетели в разы а некоторых вообще не найти пропали многие лекарства и вот это плохо это лекарство которое нужно принимать длительно и их Нельзя бросать вообще и резко тем более исчезли из аптек препараты для диабетиков и онкобольных и даже с поставками импортных антибиотиков и жаропонижающих [музыка] такие указания были мы этим гадом покажем Сами будем производить Вот только самим производить не получается ведь фармацевтические заводы в России работают на импортном сырье чиновники от Минздрава понимают это но Путин Видимо нет боятся к нему подойти что все наша индустрия фармацевтическая но на грани банкротства и поэтому надо переходить на Западное Западное во-первых 2-3 раза дороже стали в России практически все импортные товары ведь в РФ обвалился курс рубля сначала этого года упал по отношению к доллару на 16 процентов и вошел в тройку наиболее обесценившихся валют в мире глава Центробанка нам рынке сейчас наше видение предполагает постепенное нарастание инфляционного давления до конца года чтобы сбережения сохраняли свою покупательную способность с течением времени Их можно разместить на банковском депозите проценты которые банки предлагают например сегодня это 6-7 процентов которые получит вкладчик через некоторое время когда закончится они будут покрывать общие рост цен Вот только банком доверяют все меньше россиян особенно после санкций и ареста 3050 миллиардов долларов резервов Центробанка и запрета США ввозить на Личный доллар в РФ как результат некоторые удовольствие для россиян уже стали недоступными из-за цены из-за политики властей которая приводит к тотальному подорожанию всего что можно было купить к примеру в РФ запретили возить автомобили из Европы и запчасти В итоге даже стоимость подержанных авто за год взлетела на 37 процентов некоторые мои знакомые просто с первого чтения с первых же дней войны они продали свой этот марки автопром немецкий европейские цены на запчасти сразу подскочили этого там чуть ли не четверть стоимости машины Может тебе обойтись какая-то там небольшая деталь не поломка там не знаю коробка передач например какая-нибудь Элементарная та же ситуация и самолётами российских авиалиний летать на них стало попросту опасно поломки случаются всё чаще ведь после введения санкций против авиации в РФ не поставляют запчасти и комплектующие и не обслуживают её самолёты ну обычным россиянам недолётов туристические услуги и отдых в России за последние год подорожали на 15%, а денег многие уже не хватает даже на то чтобы оригинальные услуги оплатить тарифы на них повысились на 15 процентов чуть ли не единственное что дешевеет в России Это водка власть пытается сделать так чтобы народ был одурманен алкоголем А еще пропагандой телевизор изо всех сил пытается победить стремительно опустеющий холодильник А чтобы люди не задавали лишних вопросов правительство выдало вот такое распоряжение приказала за секретить ключевые экономические показатели это Явный признак того что ситуация в экономике очень тяжелая и власть Всеми силами пытается это скрыть россиянам и прячут правду и прячут правду и от региона например прячут правду и конечно пытаются Вот это они пытаются в России создавать эту Пропаганду что на них санкции не действуют информация которая подается населению она подчищается подают информацию в очень урезанном и не совсем правдивым виде но правда которую пытаются скрыть в официальной статистике становится все заметнее в реальной жизни меньше затрат на медицину меньше затрат на образование меньше затрат на инвестиционные программы по другим социальным направлениям Кремль пытается скрыть от россиян и то в каком состоянии их фонд национального благосостояния Раньше он наполнялся за счет дохода от газа и нефти и деньги из него шли на социальные выплаты Теперь когда доходы сократились не просто не наполняется и Райт из него деньги причём много и если нынешние танцы сохранятся уже до конца года в нём не останется ничего а ведь фон национального благосостояния ещё называют золотом пенсионеров одна из его функций софинансирование добровольных пенсионных накоплений граждан Вот только это золото Кремль начал активно продавать в январе например из фонда вывели 3,5 тонны этого драгоценного металла продают из фонда и валюту чтобы закрыть дыру в бюджете А уже из госказны огромная часть вырученных средств идёт на финансирование так называемой спецоперации таким образом фон национального благосостояния окончательно перестаёт быть золотом пенсионеров и становится кошельком из которого финансируется никакого золота ничего пенсионерам армию денег нету на армию нужно тратить очень хочется воевать Ну вот тут туда пойдут деньги пенсионер я-то еще одна причина почему данная расходах бюджета засекречивают Ведь все больше денег идет на войну по оценкам издания Forbes Кремль каждый месяц выделяет на это до 10 миллиардов долларов санкции делают цену войны для Москвы всё более высокой это и есть их главная цель но Путин эту цену с готовностью платит при этом уменьшая расходы на нужды обычных людей на индексацию пенсии на медицину и образование всё это оказалось на голодном пайке международный эксперты уже прогнозируют уровень жизни россиян будет падать намного быстрее чем это было на протяжении прошлого года Посмотрите на Северную Корею посмотрите Посмотрите на Кубу вот Куда движется Россия она движется к невероятной бедности ограничения которые ввели против России работают а все заявления представитель путинского режима о том что санкционные планы Запада не оправдались являются ложными если долго держать санкции и делать их все сильнее и сильнее они работают ключевые наиболее сокрушительные ограничения органа нефти нефтепродукты вступили в силу Прошлой зимой и в начале этого года Так что по-настоящему разрушительное влияние санкций начинается только сейчас ведь весь прошлый год в мире держались высокие цены на нефть и газ что позволяло Кремлю получать прибыли и создавать хоть какую-то иллюзию стабильности больше такой возможности не будет диски полностью потерял рынок Европейского Союза который раньше приносил больше всего прибыли и которому очень удобно и выгодно было качать энергоресурсы по разветвленным трубопроводам Теперь же Россия вынуждена поставлять свою нефть и нефтепродукты Китаю Индии в африканские страны и даже в латинскую Америку танкеры плывут за тысячи километров чтобы сбыть эту нефть с огромной скидкой Золотые времена изобилия нефтедолларов для Путина закончились новая покупатели уже не такие богатые и не такие сговорчивые то есть какие-то маргиналы которые готовы использовать какой-то мутный черный флот обходить подкладывать документы выключать транспондеры на танкерах чтобы их не было видно вот это удел сегодня России искать теперь на другом конце планеты своих покупателей продавать им за дешево То есть просто для них вся экономика перевернулась для них это потеря они ещё сами Я думаю не поняли что они потеряли самый большой парадокс в том что добыча нефти в России увеличивается Ара в качает всё больше и больше чтобы за счет количества компенсировать катастрофическое для Кремля падение Цен если в прошлом году он продавал нефть по цене выше чем 100 долларов за Баррель то сейчас менее чем по 60 по цене там общество штаты с санкциями нависают Европа вообще не зайдешь страховку не получишь поэтому Ну давай Вот давай подешевле нефть продают уже дешевле чем ее себестоимость на скважинах их не консервируют Лишь потому что раз консервировать снова фактически невозможно есть команда держаться любой ценой быть на плаву идти на убытки но не сокращать добычу нефти и вот люди которые Ну жили Как бога за пазуха это нефтяники газовики скоро будут очень сильные А на некоторых этих предприятиях Да держались посёлке бункеры заходят в российские порты выключают навигационные системы затем плывут в Средиземное море и там прямо на воде переливают нефть в другие танкеры чтобы замести следы но все это видно на спутнике спрятать танкер это не иголка в стоге сена То есть ты все-таки можешь отследить где он был и таким образом установить имело дело с этим токсичным ресурсом или нет законных доходов страны большой Семёрки готовят очередной 11 пакет санкций одна из его целей устранить схема обхода принятых ранее ограничений есть еще по одной прибыльной для России сфере торговля алмазами ежегодно она приносила несколько миллиардов долларов сейчас мы сфокусированы на закрытии возможности в азеек и продолжим отрезать Россию от критических поставок мы ограничим торговлю российскими алмазами российские алмазы не вечны под санкции попадут и российские медь алюминий и Никель перекроют и возможность России покупать необходимое ей оборудование в обход санкций сейчас это делают с помощью третьих стран в 10 раз нарастил покупку компьютерной техники достаточно много компаний которые покупают компьютерную технику переправляют в Российской Федерации наступает и оборудование для производства оружия и военной техники но в мире всё это видят США добавили в черный список 71 компанию за поддержку России это же делает их Европейский Союз в 11 пакете санкций у нас более 90 компаний по всему миру в отношении которых мы имеем четкие доказательства того что они нарушают санкции то есть поставляют санкционные товары непосредственно в Россию из Европейского Союза В обход через третий страны Урсула фон дер ляйн глава еврокомиссии а значит иллюзия что санкции не работают и что их можно обойти скоро окончательно развеяться Россия на сегодня страна против которой введено рекордное количество ограничений их уже более 14 тысяч больше чем против Северной Кореи и Ирана вместе взятых теперь страны большой семерки нацелены добиваться исполнения и результата от уже введенных против воров санкций и саммит в Японии показало политическая Воля для этого есть без политической воли не было бы ничего то есть на сегодняшний момент Европа едина как никогда в этом вопросе доводить эту ситуацию российской экономики обычных россиян не является целью санкций стремительное падение уровня жизни граждан это результат исключительно политики Кремля причина всех неприятностей которые происходят с Россией сегодня конечно это лично Путин Ну и его окружение которое он вовлек во все преступную войну Это очевидно совершенно но это не очевидно для подавляющего большинства глубинного народа Потому что есть Пропаганда Потому что есть промывание мозгов это промывание мозгов на протяжении последних 23 лет ведётся крайне интенсивно Парадокс но пока санкции больно бьют по экономике РФ и обычным гражданам приближённая к Кремлю бизнесмена Наоборот богатеют за последние год в России стала на 22 млрдра больше почитала издание Forbes совокупное состояние всех российских миллиардеров тоже выросла смотреть и здесь всё объясняется принципом кому война а кому Мать родна это условно условный бизнес который обслуживает войну но это опять-таки сложно назвать бизнесом наверное обогатились крупные бизнесмены которая курировали обход санкций миллиардеры которые в частности работают на торговле внутренней То есть это возможность через этих миллиардеро…",UCwTJmkKiK741l86GvtTUjKg

Hope he&#39;s not an Aussie. There he is. Hello mate. Hello Tuffers. How are ya? Great to see you. And you, all set? All set. Let’s go. Well, this is a very impressive motor. You win it? You steal it? Good to share a lift with you. Saves me a few quid. Yes that’s right gets more cars off the road doesn’t it. Absolutely it does. Less traffic. You must be used to sharing lifts with people. Coach back in the day, I can imagine you, Beefy, Gooch. Yeah, it was all part of it. we used to tour around. From city to city, from test to test. and obviously, we used to get in the coaches all the time going to the grounds, which were usually quite good fun. Played twelve years for England only missed the coach three times. I think that’s a pretty good ratio. Did your coach think that was a good ratio? No. When I was starting out as a stand up. You’d get an email on the day here&#39;s the time, here&#39;s who you&#39;re picking up here&#39;s the venue. Sometimes it would be like can you give a lift to you know, Michael McIntyre, and you&#39;re a young comedian
going, yeah this gonna be amazing. You really form bonds over a three and a half hour drive. And you discover shared interests
with strangers you might not know. You and I, both big golf fans. Absolutely, love a bit of golf. Have you played in any four balls
 at golf with anyone we might know?  Well, the cricketers love the golf. Very good golfers as well. Especially the batsmen they absolutely smash it a mile. Okay well here’s the question. You only get one answer. Botham, Flintoff or Stokes? God, it&#39;s a tough question. Captains wise, who would I want to be captain? Ben Stokes. He&#39;s probably one of the best England captains I&#39;ve seen. We’re going to the cricket today but you can Liftshare for anything really. Absolutely. When I was a teenager going to music festivals, it was the best bit it was the excitement. It was. And you’d be in the traffic and you’d spot other cars near you full of people. And you’d know you were going to the same place. You could just tell. Should be approaching our Liftshare Dave. Do you know what he looks like? I don&#39;t. That might be him. Look at those muscles. Is there going to be room for him, we might have to put him in the boot. Alright Dave. Hey guys. Hello mate. How are ya? Good Tuffers? Yes! Tuffers, oh my, what a pleasure. Name’s John, nice to meet ya mate. Dave, nice to meet ya. Get involved, strap yourself in. Here we go. Well nice to have you on board mate. Nah that&#39;s alright. What do you do for a living Dave? I coach cricket for a living. Coaching the women’s game. Oh well, I mean it’s just exploded, hasn’t it, the women’s game. It’s a fantastic time because just seeing now almost like this whole new game emerging. The women’s game has become this new product and it’s just fantastic. You use Liftshare a lot? All the time. Yeah? I love it You&#39;ll find out from this journey that I love a chat. I love talking. Sometimes I actually forget I&#39;m going to a destination, because I just get a chance to meet 
people and chat to them in the car. So, how about A to Z cricketers? Oh, okay. I&#39;ll start things off with, Alec Stewart. Oh okay, it&#39;s first names is it? Yeah. Do I go next? Yeah, you go next. Bob Willis Bob Willis, so C. Oh man, I hate quizzes. So Dave, what have you always wanted to ask Phil Tufnell? Because he can&#39;t go anywhere now. What was it like playing for England? Well, I mean, it was a huge honour. To represent your country is a great feeling and it doesn&#39;t go away from you. That first moment, it&#39;s sort of still the same your twentieth time as well. Uhh, F. There&#39;s a double here Frank Frank Hayes Freddie Flintoff. Ah you could’ve had a double. Ah I could have. Ohhhh. I’ll have a double. Graham Gooch. What would you say Tuffers has been the biggest difference between the game now if you had to sort of pinpoint one thing between what the game is now and when you played? Fitness, strength and conditioning, diet. I mean, we were all pretty fit when we played but I mean, these guys now are you know, they are,  you know they are machines. Heather Knight. Ohhh Belter. What&#39;s after H? I. I. I was thinking I was running through the alphabet in my head. If you&#39;re struggling with the alphabet part of the game. I&#39;m gonna go for, Paul Fairbrother. No, no, no, no, oh no I’m frozen out. Paul, no what’s his name? Neil Fairbrother, or Paul Farbrace. That&#39;s it. Yes. Neil Fairbrother, was my idol growing up as a young left hander. Well, what a glorious morning to be off to the match. Gonna, pick up my mate John, and then off to pick up Dave, using Liftshare. Hope he&#39;s not an Aussie. There he is. Hello mate. Hello Tuffers.

It’s a fantastic time because just seeing now almost like this whole new game emerging. The women’s game has become this new product and it’s just fantastic. You use Liftshare a lot? All the time. Yeah? I love it You&#39;ll find out from this journey that I love a chat. I love talking. Sometimes I actually forget I&#39;m going to a destination, because I just get a chance to meet 
people and chat to them in the car. So, how about A to Z cricketers? Oh, okay. I&#39;ll start things off with, Alec Stewart. Oh okay, it&#39;s first names is it? Yeah. Do I go next? Yeah, you go next. Bob Willis Bob Willis, so C. Oh man, I hate quizzes. So Dave, what have you always wanted to ask Phil Tufnell? Because he can&#39;t go anywhere now. What was it like playing for England? Well, I mean, it was a huge honour. To represent your country is a great feeling and it doesn&#39;t go away from you. That first moment, it&#39;s sort of still the same your twentieth time as well. Uhh, F. There&#39;s a double here Frank Frank Hayes Freddie Flintoff. Ah you could’ve had a double. Ah I could have. Ohhhh. I’ll have a double. Graham Gooch. What would you say Tuffers has been the biggest difference between the game now if you had to sort of pinpoint one thing between what the game is now and when you played? Fitness, strength and conditioning, diet. I mean, we were all pretty fit when we played but I mean, these guys now are you know, they are,  you know they are machines. Heather Knight. Ohhh Belter. What&#39;s after H? I. I. I was thinking I was running through the alphabet in my head. If you&#39;re struggling with the alphabet part of the game. I&#39;m gonna go for, Paul Fairbrother. No, no, no, no, oh no I’m frozen out. Paul, no what’s his name? Neil Fairbrother, or Paul Farbrace. That&#39;s it. Yes. Neil Fairbrother, was my idol growing up as a young left hander.",UChzbU5hPpOq6pDdQARykJcw

","If you were to make a list of the companies in the world that have a credible chance of actually bending the curve for the world&#39;s path to net zero, then I put ExxonMobil at the top of that list. Our customers are recognizing the knowledge and depth that we bring to the table. We know our customers are placing significant weight on our execution capability. They&#39;re wanting a partner they can count on to deliver. The chart shows the sources of the 33 billion metric tons of energy related CO2 emissions that the world generates today. And what&#39;s interesting here is the huge proportion of emissions that come from industrial sources, from power generation, and from commercial transportation. And together they account for 80 percent of all energy related emissions, and these are the hard to decarbonize sectors that we at ExxonMobil are most focused on. And that&#39;s where our capabilities come in. Our Low Carbon Solutions business is intensely focused on helping to accelerate the world&#39;s path to net zero by making that path economically viable and making it executable at a scale that matters. We offer a one-stop shop CCS solution from capture through transportation to storage and that will enable these customers  to reduce their emissions. We&#39;re getting underway with execution plans for building a world-scale, low-carbon, hydrogen plant. Our majority owned affiliate, Imperial Oil, announced final investment decision for a 20 kbd renewable diesel facility at the Strathcona refinery in Canada. We have tremendous advantage  built on our technology, our scale, our project execution, and our value chain integration. Momentum is definitely starting to build and it&#39;s going to be an exciting and high impact time ahead.",UCvNc3rg1Aa9wSPECYWEfcPg

","DAC is an essential technology for meeting society&#39;s net-zero emission goals and is complementary to other emission-reduction solutions. Switching to lower-emission energy sources gets us most of the way there, but even fuel switching and the leading abatement technologies can&#39;t mitigate emissions completely. This leaves a significant amount of emissions that still need to be managed. That&#39;s where negative-emission technology like DAC comes in. DAC captures more CO2 from the atmosphere than it produces, essentially generating a credit that can be used to offset the emissions. Carbon captured and sequestered by DAC is more easily measured and verified than other negative-emissions technologies, making DAC a good option for ensuring we can truly get to net zero.",UCvNc3rg1Aa9wSPECYWEfcPg

We’re starting with the technologies that match our strengths -- carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. We have agreements in place to transport and store up to 5 million metric tons of CO₂ a year for three of our customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today. We’re also planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas, at planned start up. We plan to invest $17 billion through 2027 on lower-emission initiatives. Matt shared the stage with Takajiro “Tak” Ishikawa, president and CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) America. ExxonMobil and MHI have a strategic alliance on #carboncapture technology. They discussed the value of working with start-ups on cutting-edge technology, the need for creative solutions in countries that lack geologic formations for CO₂ storage, and the growing demand from industries seeking help to reduce their emissions. The panel also included Charles McConnell, executive director of carbon management and energy sustainability at the University of Houston and Uday Turaga, CEO of ADI Analytics.

732541962251228,"“The energy transition is a global challenge – it’s not one size fits all.”
  
 

  Those are the words of Matt Crocker, senior vice president for our Low Carbon Solutions business, at a recent Houston Asia Society event, where he shared our plan to help accelerate the world’s path to net zero emissions. We’re starting with the technologies that match our strengths -- carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels.
  
 

  We have agreements in place to transport and store up to 5 million metric tons of CO₂ a year for three of our customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today. We’re also planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas, at planned start up.
  
 

  We plan to invest $17 billion through 2027 on lower-emission initiatives.

Those are the words of Matt Crocker, senior vice president for our Low Carbon Solutions business, at a recent Houston Asia Society event, where he shared our plan to help accelerate the world’s path to net zero emissions. We’re starting with the technologies that match our strengths -- carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels.

We have agreements in place to transport and store up to 5 million metric tons of CO₂ a year for three of our customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today. We’re also planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas, at planned start up.

We plan to invest $17 billion through 2027 on lower-emission initiatives.

  In her address to delegates, our Chairperson and Managing Director, Tera Shandro, mapped out the future of Papua New Guinea’s resource opportunities and reinforced the growing importance of #LNG towards the security of supply, and the energy transition.
  
  “As the world’s population increases, so too does its need for affordable, secure, and reliable energy, with improved emissions intensity compared to legacy sources,” Ms Shandro said.
  
  “Natural gas, and particularly LNG, will play a vital role in meeting this demand and support climate goals, as it emits up to 60 percent fewer greenhouse gases and significantly fewer air pollutants when compared with traditional energy sources. With 40 percent of the world’s electricity still being generated by coal, there are many opportunities for meaningful emissions reductions by making the switch to natural gas, and that’s why it sits at the center of our strategy.
  
  “From ExxonMobil’s perspective, Asia Pacific countries are expected to be a core natural gas customer for decades to come and will continue turning to Papua New Guinea thanks to its proximity, high quality resources and efficient and reliable operating facilities.
  
  “#PNGLNG is already leading the world in energy emissions intensity and reliability, but as we look to our latest investment, the Papua LNG Project alongside TotalEnergies, its proposed plans are an example of how new technology applied to proven processes, such as electric trains, can help provide affordable energy in a lower-carbon world.

Do you know the next rising star? Could it be you? This first category will honour an outstanding woman under the age of 35 who is excelling in the early stages of the LNG career. A you or your colleague, a pioneer of business, innovation or technology. This second category will honour a woman who has delivered outstanding business results or innovation and technology leadership amid the ever evolving energy transition landscape. Thus being an ambassador by leading and uplifting fellow peers, some like you or someone you know, this third category will honour a proper New Guinea who threw their wets, actions and positive energy, inspires those who work with and around them. Enter today, nominations are now open for the Powerplay Awards' company. From business support to technical, to catering, labour hire and more.

  Reflecting on his return, Peter said “over the past several years I’ve watched ExxonMobil PNG from afar and have been amazed at not only what has been achieved but how the team has achieved it. 
  
 

  “While it is hard to narrow down the highlights, seeing the initial project commissioning and production ramp up well ahead of schedule, to proudly building a strong Papua New Guinean workforce, to developing local suppliers and supporting landowner companies, to supporting the communities in which we operate, to navigating the challenges of COVID-19, and all of this while continuing to improve ExxonMobil PNG’s safety and environmental performance.

1189463634850768,"Snakes are an important part of Papua New Guinea’s biodiversity and play a crucial role in balancing the ecosystem. We celebrated #worldenvironmentday on Saturday 5 June by catching up with #PNGLNG resident snake handler Owen Paiva, who safely removes snakes from the LNG Plant (LNGP) and relocates them to similar environments away from people and local communities.
  
  “The environment we live in always has a balance in place where living things play specific roles and depend on each other – this is ecology. When a component of that balance is affected, it can cause a shift to all that rely on it,” shared Owen. 
  
  Since 2004, Owen has been involved in snakebite research and safely handling venomous snakes. Before joining International SOS (ISOS) and working at the LNG Plant, he managed a NGO-based snakebite and venom research laboratory – the Charles Campbell Toxinology Centre (CCTC). 
  
  “Many snakes feed on rodents, lizards and even other snakes, while other snakes feed on frogs, and some on aquatic animals. Some birds like eagles, kookaburras, and owls depend on snakes for their diet. If the number of snakes decreases in an environment then the population of rodents and lizards may increase, and birds and other species that depend on snakes as food may also suffer. Snakes have their part to play in maintaining this environmental balance.”
  
  Since joining ISOS last year and working at LNGP, Owen credits the zero number of snakebite incidents to ExxonMobil PNG’s strong safety protocols which are similar to those he practiced at CCTC – something Owen believes has contributed to never being bitten by a venomous snake in 15 years. 
  
  Communities neighbouring LNGP are home to 12 different species of snakes including Papuan taipan, whipsnakes, carpet pythons, amethystine pythons, olive pythons, slatey grey snakes, common tree snakes, brown tree snakes, mangrove snakes, blind snakes and sea kraits.
